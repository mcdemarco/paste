Each paste has a public link that can be viewed without logging in to app.net, but an app.net account is required to create pastes.  Logged-in users also see a list of their own recent pastes.\r\n\r\nabout\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPaste-app is a pasteboard/pinboard running on the social networking platform app.net.  Paste-app is the brainchild of Jonathon Duerig, @duerig, and is based on his code from the first session in the Learning the app.net API 101 patter room:  \r\nhttp://orbt.io/OrDC.pdf   \r\nhttp://patter-app.net/room.html?channel=14380\r\n\r\nusage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEach paste has a public link that can be viewed without logging in to app.net, as well as a \"private\" link which will display both the selected paste and a list of the logged-in user's recent pastes.  To create a new paste, you will need a (free) app.net account.  Pastes now have an optional title, type, and tags.\r\n\r\nsausage\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPastes are messages in a user-created channel of type net.paste-app.clip.  The paste text itself is contained in an annotation of type net.paste-app.clip, while the message text contains the private link to the paste.  (The public link is a base 36 encoding of the channel and message IDs, which allows retrieval without authentication.)  You can direct the user to the private link (the paste-app.net website) to view the paste or retrieve the message yourself to display within an app.  The code is all client-side and is available at github, but you will need either mod_rewrite (the .htaccess file) or Amazon-style rerouting (the .aws-routing file) to resolve paste urls.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibraries\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe app uses appnet.js, jquery, mustache.js, purl.js (for url handling), highlight.js (for code highlighting), and Skeleton, a responsive HTML5 template.  The ransom note font used in the images is BlackCasper by AllencHIU cHIU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
